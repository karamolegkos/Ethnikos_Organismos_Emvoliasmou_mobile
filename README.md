# Ethnikos_Organismos_Emvoliasmou_mobile

The mobile App "Ethniko Organismos Emvoliasmou" is a project made by me, for the subject of "Online Programming" in the Department of Digital Systems (University Of Piraeus).

It contains the files below:
- Mobile_App (Directory): A directory containing the project "EthinkosOrganismosEmboliasmou", having all the files needed to run the Application in the Android Studio.
- Report.pdf: A report for the project in the Greek Language, containing information on how to use it and how it was made.

This project was made using HTML, Java, the Retrofit Framework, XML and SQLite.

To Run the application, download the files of the project, extract them and then just import the whole "EthinkosOrganismosEmboliasmou" project in your Android Studion Projects.

You are now ready to use the application :)
